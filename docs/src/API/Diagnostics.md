# Diagnostics

```@meta
CurrentModule = CalibrateEDMF.Diagnostics
```

This module defines and implements diagnostics of the training process. Diagnostics are organized into groups (defined as dictionaries `io_dictionary_...`) and written to file in netCDF4 format. All implemented dictionaries, as well as all their entries, are defined below. These include error metrics, parameter ensembles and their statistical moments, validation diagnostics, and more. 

The diagnostics are meant to evolve organically as users require more information regarding the training process. If you can think of diagnostics that may be useful to a wide range of users, consider opening an issue or pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/CliMA/CalibrateEDMF.jl).

Data within the resulting `Diagnostics.nc` file can be analyzed using the Julia package [NCDatasets.jl](https://alexander-barth.github.io/NCDatasets.jl/stable/). The file can also be processed using software written in other popular programming languages like python through [netCDF4-python](http://unidata.github.io/netcdf4-python/) or [xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/).
