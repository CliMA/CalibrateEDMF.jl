CalibrateEDMF is a julia package that enables the calibration of atmospheric turbulence and convection parameterizations using gradient-free ensemble Kalman methods. It provides a user-friendly framework to train parameterizations implemented in [TurbulenceConvection.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/TurbulenceConvection.jl), using the ensemble-based optimization methods implemented in [EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl).

Some of the options enabled by the package are:

- Automatic regularization of parameter learning as an inverse problem,
- Minibatch training using EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl,
- Kalman inversion with isotropic or anisotropic regularization,
- Tracking of validation diagnostics, given a user-specified validation dataset.

The rationale behind the calibration framework implemented in this package is thoroughly described in our paper:

If you use this package for your own research, or find any of the ideas presented useful, please cite our work. The article also includes results for an extended eddy-diffusivity mass-flux (EDMF) closure of turbulence and convection trained using this package. The EDMF scheme is implemented in [TurbulenceConvection.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/TurbulenceConvection.jl), and described in the following papers:
